# Garmin-Heatmaps
The purpose of this project was to produce a visualisation of the areas I've run in, so I can select future running courses based around where I haven't yet been. This was done utilising the the location data generated by my Garmin device and python libraries to process and plot the data onto google maps. The goal being to produce a map broadly similar to Strava's global heatmaps, but just for myself.

This is more a test of concept and learning exercise than a working script because the process isn't automated and the steps involved require oversight. Google's mapping api also doesn't seem to behave well with the library I used to plot courses over the map. But it does work nonetheless.
