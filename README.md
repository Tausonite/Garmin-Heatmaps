# Garmin-Heatmaps
The purpose of this script was to generate a heatmap of areas I've run in, utilising the location data generated by my Garmin device and python libraries to process and plot the data onto google maps as a heatmap, so I can see the areas I've run in most. 

This is more a test of concept and learning exercise than a working script because the process isn't automated and needs to be pointed at the necessary files. But it does work.
